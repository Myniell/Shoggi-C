# Shoggi-C
This is a C program attempting to recreate a terminal version for the Shoggi game.

The basics of the game have been covered. Unfortunately the list section which tracks the captured pieces was not implemented correctly and needs some more work.

[x] - Create the board
[x] - Create all the pieces
[x] - Define all the correct movements
[ ] - Create the lists that track the piece movements and captures
[ ] - Implement the "Recapture" mechanic
[x] - Create the main program
[x] - Create save and load option
